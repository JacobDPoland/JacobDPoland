Hi! My name is Jacob. This is why you should hire me:
- I am a mega-nerd with a love for solving problems with technology.
- Python is my favorite language, but I have experience in multiple programming languages, technologies, applications, and operating systems.
- My written communication skills are fantastic. I have professional experience writing technical documents and facilitating remote communication.
- I possess fine verbal communication skills. 
- I can be very persistent. If I haven't solved your problem before, I have either heard of a way to or will find a way to. 
- I am a quick learner. These days, with a little time with YouTube, StackOverflow, and GitHub, I can do just about anything.
- I earned an Associate's degree in high school.
- I doubt you've read this far down, but I'd like you to know that I have a light-hearted sense of humor, which I know is good for team morale.
- Also, consider the following stats:
